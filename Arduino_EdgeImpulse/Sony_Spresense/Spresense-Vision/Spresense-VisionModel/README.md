This INO shows how to read the Sony Spresense camera and make machine learning (ML) inferences on images captured by the ML model. The model is created with the [Edge Impulse Studio](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/). Create your own vision model and `#include` it. Replace my exported library `#include <Cup_inferencing.h>` that is the float model exported from the Edge Impulse Studio as an Arduino library with your library.
