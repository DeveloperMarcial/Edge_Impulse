**Project Description**

This project reads the analog voltage of a moisture sensor. A machine learning (ML) model was developed that predicts if the soil in a houseplant is dry or wet. (Yes, not very exciting but shows an end-to-end solution that can be adapted very easliy.) The model was developed using the [Edge Impulse Studio](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/), a web based ML model creation tool.  The predictions are made on a small microcontroller unit (MCU), called the [Spresense](https://developer.sony.com/develop/spresense/specifications), running near the plant. The MCU incorporated a library generated by Edge Impulse and programmed in the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).  The results of the machine learning inference are sent over LoRa to an LoRaWAN internet connected gateway.  The gateway is configured to send data to *The Things Network* (TTN). A custom application in my TTN Console was created to recieve the data package created on the Sprecense MCU. In the TTN application a webhook was configured to send data to *ThingsSpeak* for charting and public display. (Since I don't have a Sony Spresense I can dedicate to daily logging to ThingsSpeak, take a look at this example of what can be done: https://thingspeak.com/channels/1623648)
