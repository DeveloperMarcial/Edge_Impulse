**Hardware**
* This project uses a PCB called the `Spresense-Sensor-EVK-701` that hosts multiple sensors.
* The `Spresense-Sensor-EVK-701` plug directly into the Sony Spresense MCU.
* There are other PCBs with similar names:
  * `Spresense-WiSUN-EVK-701` Info [here](https://www.rohm.com/support/spresense-add-on-board)
  * `Spresense-BLE-EVK-701` Info [here](https://www.rohm.com/support/spresense-add-on-board)
* The manufacturer of the KX126 called Rohm has an Arduino library [here](https://github.com/RohmSemiconductor/Arduino/tree/master/KX126).
* The `Spresense-Sensor-EVK-701` that hosts the `KX126` looks like this:
