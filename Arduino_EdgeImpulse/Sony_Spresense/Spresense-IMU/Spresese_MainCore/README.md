This program is intended to work with "Spresese-Dual-Mode-IMU.ino".

The purpose of this program is to boot SubCore1 and allow the machine learning (ML) model deployed from Edge Impulse Studio to make
inferences on data from the KX224 IMU.

These 2 programs answer the question:
* "Can a IMU data based model run on an Spresense SubCore?"
The answer is yes.

NOTE: A ML model that reads the Spresense camera or microphones cannot run on a SubCore.
